So You’ve Decided to Start Maker Community :)

YAY! We’re excited to have people like you join our growing community and want to help you get Maker Comminity launched as quickly and painlessly as possible. If our experience is any indication, your first major event will galvanize and inspire the Maker community in your area and create momentum for subsequent events, so it’s crucial to start things off on the right foot!

To help you get started, we’ve created Maker Community kit for starting Maker Community in your city.
